abstract: This paper presents a voice user interface consisting of several
  modules for a mobile service robot, which is used to guide people and provide
  information on a university campus. The recognition and processing system is
  based on cloud services to convert from speech to text and vice versa and a
  dialogue system to allow for natural interaction. An approach to combine these
  modules with a data management system for meal plan, public transit, and
  location information is presented. We evaluate the system in different
  environments, each with their individual reverberation times, proving the
  functionality under conditions typical for the intended use case. In a user
  study with 13 participants we show the usability of the system, by letting the
  participants freely interact with the robot. In 86 % of all cases the desired
  output can be achieved at least once per user and request. A questionnare
  shows that most users agree with a good usability of the system.
