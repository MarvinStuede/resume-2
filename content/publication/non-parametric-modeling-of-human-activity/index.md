abstract: 	This work presents a non-parametric spatio-temporal model for mapping human activity by mobile autonomous robots in a long-term context. Based on Variational Gaussian Process Regression, the model incorporates prior information of spatial and temporal-periodic dependencies to create a continuous representation of human occurrences. The inhomogeneous data distribution resulting from movements of the robot is included in the model via a heteroscedastic likelihood function and can be accounted for as predictive uncertainty. Using a sparse formulation, data sets over multiple weeks and several hundred square meters can be used for model creation. The experimental evaluation, based on multi-week data sets, demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art both in terms of predictive quality and subsequent path planning.
