## About Me

I am a robotics engineer working at ZF group in Perception & ADAS Systems.

What fascinates me most about robotics and autonomous systems is the interplay of different complex disciplines that all have their own challenges. Therefore, it was inspiring for me to develop the autonomous service robot [Sobi](/project/sobi/) in my PhD project.
Currently, I lead an innovation project within ZF to enable camera-based near-field detection functions for commercial vehicles.
