## About Me

I am a robotics engineer working at ZF group in the area of Perception & ADAS Systems.

For me, the fascinating thing about robotics and autonomous systems is the interplay of different complex disciplines that all have their own challenges. Therefore, it was a particularly exciting task for me to develop the autonomous service robot [Sobi](/project/sobi/) in my last project.
