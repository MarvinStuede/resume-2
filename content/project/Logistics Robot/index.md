This was a study project over the course of one semester to apply object oriented programming methods to mobile robots. We were 10 teams, each consisting of two team members, and were given tasks in the field of logistics. The main task was autonomous driving with a mobile robot in a logistics scenario considering robot localization on a map, environment recognition (color markings, obstacles) and planned job execution. The robot was pogrammed with C++ on the microcontroller Raspberry Pi.

We successfully completed the competition and even managed to achieve the first place.
