In this hackathon I first learned about working in mobile robotics with C++, doing image processing with OpenCV as well as localisation and navigation with ROS.

We were given a task we had to solve independently in two teams in a competition within a week. To complete the task, sub-tasks from mobile robotics had to be implemented practically. The main task was to recognize colored blocks based on images, load them and deliver them to specific locations in an arena.
