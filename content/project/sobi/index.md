Sobi is a mobile social service robot that I develop as part of my PhD project at the Leibniz University Hannover, [Institute for Mechatronic Systems](https://www.imes.uni-hannover.de/en/). The robot was designed for use on the _Campus Maschinenbau_ which is the [Campus of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.maschinenbau.uni-hannover.de/en/faculty/mechanical-engineering-campus/) at Leibniz University. The robot's purpose is to provide information about the campus and to guide visitors to interesting places.

Therefore Sobi was developed for long-term autonomous operation. The built-in sensors allow fully autonomous operation inside and partially autonomous operation outside buildings on campus.
Since the project to develop Sobi started in 2018 and the robot has been designed and constructed from then on, it is continuously being further improved.

The entire project, i.e. the hardware and software design of the robot, is **open source** and all components can be freely used. You can find the documentation [here](https://marvinstuede.github.io/Sobi/).
