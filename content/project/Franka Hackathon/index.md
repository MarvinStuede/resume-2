During this hackathon we got the chance to be the very first students working with the Franka Emika Panda Robot (which was still a prototype back then).

We were a total of four teams, each with an individual task to teach the robot an everyday-activity within one week. For our robot we implemented the functionality to brew coffee with a coffeemaker. For this process we developed a State Machine, to open the coffee tray, grasp a spoon, fill in the coffee, fill in the water, start the brewing and serve the coffee at the end.

I was responsible for the CAD design of the End effector and all other CAD parts we needed for this process and also gave some support in State Machine Design.

During this week we did not get much sleep, but in the end it worked as planned and the task was successfully implemented.
