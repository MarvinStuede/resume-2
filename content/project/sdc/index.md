This was a competition I did during school and one of the first robots I ever built. The competition consisted of building a remote controlled robot with a standardized set of components.

The robots tasks were to grasp different objects in an area and drop them off at specific places. Although we only achieved fourth place out of ten, my enthusiasm was sparked and robots fascinated me from then on.
