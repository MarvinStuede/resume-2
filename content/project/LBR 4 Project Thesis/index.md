This was by project thesis, which I did in 2014 on an LBR 4 +. I developed a state machine with MATLAB StateFlow, representing different states for a robot-assisted laser surgery system. Based on the state, the control architecture set several safety features for the robot (moving directions, max velocities etc.)
